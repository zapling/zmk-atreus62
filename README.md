# zmk-atreus62

Research project - Wireless Atreus62 [Battery powered] [Bluetooth]

# Goal with this project

Research and document the process of replacing the the Pro Micro controller with the nice!nano controller. The nice!nano has both bluetooth and onboard charging
which makes it ideal for a wireless keyboard project. nice!nano is also designed to hopefully be a drop in replacement for the Pro Micro controller. 

# TODO

- Port my Atreus62 QMK firmware to ZMT
  - Unicode input not yet supported, workaround seems to exist https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/issues/232
- ~~Purchase `nice!micro` controller~~ and a suitable battery. https://zmkfirmware.dev/power-profiler/
- Figure out Pro Micro Pinout schema and how it maps to the one found on nice!nano.
